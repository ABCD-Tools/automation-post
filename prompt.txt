## Next Steps After Developer Zip Installation

After successfully downloading and running the developer zip locally:

### Current Status
- ✅ Developer zip downloaded and extracted
- ✅ Agent running locally (verified via logs)
- ✅ API connectivity confirmed (ping test passes)

### Next Todo Items

1. **Add Installer Directory Feedback to Website**
   - Create API endpoint to receive installer directory path from client
   - Update client registration to send installer directory path
   - Display installer directory in website dashboard/settings
   - Show status: "Agent installed at: [directory path]"
   - This allows users to proceed to next step (add accounts and posts)

2. **Enable Account Management**
   - Once installer directory is confirmed, allow users to:
     - Add social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter)
     - Verify account connectivity
     - Store account credentials securely (encrypted)

3. **Enable Post Creation**
   - After accounts are added, enable post creation workflow:
     - Upload images
     - Write captions
     - Select target accounts
     - Schedule or post immediately
     - Monitor job execution status

### Implementation Notes
- The installer directory should be sent during client registration (already has `installPath` in registerClient)
- Need to add UI component to display installer directory in settings/agents page
- Need to add validation to ensure agent is properly installed before allowing account/post operations
